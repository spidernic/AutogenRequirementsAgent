## **AutoRequirementsAgent**

**Description:**

**AutoRequirementsAgent** is a Python-based automation tool that generates comprehensive plans and detailed requirements for any given topic. Leveraging the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, it follows a structured approach to:

- **Create a logical plan** based on the provided topic.
- **Detail functional, non-functional, integration, and operational requirements.**
- **Simulate a QA Manager's review** for completeness and adherence to standards.
- **Save all outputs** for easy access and further processing.

This tool streamlines the initial phases of project planning and requirements analysis, making it invaluable for developers, project managers, business analysts, and system architects.
