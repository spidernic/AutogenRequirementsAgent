## **AutoRequirementsAgent**

** Experiment **
- Forcing STRICT JSON format messaging between AI agents.
- Testing State Transition function:
  - [ ] Reading individual messages between agents, in JSON, looking for specific value-keys with specific content
  - [ ] Adding DoCase logic based on the content.
  - [ ] Double checking results for inference in math operations (using python calculation), semantic error trapping. 
- Nested Groupchat (like the inner monologue, but a bit different)

** Preliminary results **
** Works well and is consistent using select finetuned OSS LLMs.**
Tested in:
- [ ] Ollama for serving local LLMs ** ([Ollama.com](https://ollama.com))
- [ ] Nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF (https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF)

## **Experiment description:**

**AutoRequirementsAgent** is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of generating and refining requirements for any project or topic. Powered by **Open Source LLMs**, it leverages advanced natural language understanding to:

- **Generate a logical plan** tailored to the given topic.
- **Detail requirements** across functional, non-functional, integration, and operational dimensions.
- **Simulate a QA Managerâ€™s review process** for rigorous quality assurance.
- **Output requirements** in JSON and text formats for seamless integration and documentation.

This tool is ideal for developers, project managers, business analysts, and system architects seeking to save time, ensure consistency, and improve the quality of their requirements gathering process.
