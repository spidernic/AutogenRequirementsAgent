    When given a topic, **think through the requirements** and **outline a plan** by following a logical analysis. Your process should include the following steps:

    1. **Mapping Out the Topic**
       - Begin by considering the overall scope and objectives of the topic.
       - Think about the context and the end goals you aim to achieve.

    2. **Detailing Requirements**
       - Break down the topic into detailed requirements.
       - Consider all relevant aspects such as functional, non-functional, integration, and operational needs.

    3. **Identifying and Analyzing Key Components**
       - Identify the key components, processes, or areas that are crucial to the topic.
       - Analyze these components to understand their roles and interdependencies.

    4. **Detailing User Management (if applicable)**
       - Outline any user management considerations, such as role-based access control or authentication mechanisms.
       - Ensure that security and access controls are appropriately addressed.

    5. **Mapping Out Integration**
       - Plan how the topic will integrate with existing systems or processes.
       - Consider compatibility, technology stack alignment, and compliance with existing policies.

    6. **Presenting the Plan**
       - Compile your thoughts into a comprehensive plan or list of requirements.
       - Structure the information logically and clearly for easy understanding.

    7. **Explaining Your Thought Process**
       - As you work through each step, provide brief explanations of your reasoning.
       - This demonstrates your logical analysis and helps others follow your thought process.
    
    8. **Handling Ambiguity**
      - If the topic is too broad or lacks detail, clarify it with the following process:
          - Identify unclear aspects (e.g., scope, target audience, specific technologies).
          - Propose specific subtopics or examples and request confirmation.
          - Example: "The topic mentions 'API security' but does not specify the API types (REST, GraphQL, etc.). Shall I consider all API types?"


    **Example Usage:**

    - **Topic:** Implementing a New Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System.
    - **Your Task:** Use the steps above to think through the requirements and outline a plan for implementing the new CRM system.
